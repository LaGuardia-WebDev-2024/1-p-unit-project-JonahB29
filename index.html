    <h1>Gymnastics, A Crash Course!</h1>
    <p>

      is <strong>Artistic Gymnastics</strong>. With big names in mainstream
      media, such as Stephen Nedoroscik on DWTS, as well as thesport being a
      headline event at the Olympics, Artistic Gymnastics is arguably the most
      popular form of gymnastics. For the purpouses of this webpage we will
      focus on Artistic Gymnastics. There are 2 types of Artistic Gymnastics,

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      There are 2 parts to a gymnastics score, Difficulty and Execution.
      Difficulty is as it sounds like, how difficult the exercise is. Execution
      is how well the exercise is competed. The sum of these two scores
      determine the final score. The Code of Points outines the rules and
      scoring procedures for gymnastics and is updated every 4 years for the
      next Olympic quadrennium.

              The first component of a gymnastics score is the top 8 most
              difficult elements in the routine
            </li>
            <li>
              Each element is assigned a value based on its difficulty.
              <ul>
                <li>A=0.1 (least difficult elements)</li>
                <li>B=0.2</li>
                <li>C=0.3</li>
                <li>D=0.4</li>
                <li>E=0.5</li>

            <li>
              The second component of a gymnastics score is connection value
              abbreviated as CV. This is a bonus of either 0.1 or 0.2 for
              linking difficult elements together.
            </li>
            <li>
              The third component of a gymnastics score is a 0.5 for fullfilling
              a composition requirent for a routine. Men have 3 composition
              requirements and a dismount requirement, while women have 4
              composition requirements and no dismount requirement.
